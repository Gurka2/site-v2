# Summer Game Jam 2021
*17:00 10th July - 17:00 25th July*

This summer we are going to host an experimental chill Summer Game Jam. During the jam we are going to experiment with the format. Instead of just having the jam taking place during one weekend it will take place during 3 weekends; one for group forming, second one for half time review and last one for final review. Of course you are free to work as much as you want on the project and can drop in or out as it suits your schedule. We are really curious to see what people can create when they get a little bit more time and are looking forward to the results.

# What is a game jam?

A game jam is an event where programmers, artists and gamers come together to
create games; both computer games and board games. At our game jam there is a
48 hours time limit and a randomized theme for inspiration.

# FAQ

### Am I welcome?

All are welcome, student and non-student alike. No previous experience is
needed and the event is free of charge.

### Where are your events held?

Due to COVID-19 events are held remotely via [LiU Game Jam's Discord
server](https://discord.gg/tP2kDvgQKn). We hope to return to physical jams once
that is over.

### How are groups selected? Do I need a team?

Groups will be randomized for brainstorming purposes, but you are free to work
with whomever you like. The starting groups will allow you to find people
sharing similar ideas. We make sure everyone finds someone to work with.

### Do I need to be able to program?

Not at all! Game design covers all kind of fields such as art, music, design,
storywriting, level creation and problemsolving. Anyone who is eager to create
is welcome.
