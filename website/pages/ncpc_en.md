## Details

Because of the circumstances the arrangers have decided to host a hybrid
competition similar to last year. This means that teams that want to compete
from home, and all other teams, can use one computer per person instead of the
usual one computer per team.

LiTHe kod will provide access to computer labs, free lunch and baloons for
solved problems during the competition. But because the rules above it is not a
must for participating. For those on campus the day starts 10:00am in Ada
Lovelace, entrance 27 in the B-house, with information about the rules and some
words from our sponsors.

There will also be a warmup one week before the competition (October 2nd) with
start ~11:00am. The warmup competition will be on Kattis for anyone who wants
to test out the system. Come and ask questions about competetive programming or
NCPC! There is not specific schedule, so if you wonder about how competetive
programming actually works, this is the time to ask. (You can of course ask us
on regular meetups as well.)

Registration is not yet open. Come back later!

If you want to compete but don't have a team and don't want to compete alone
(or if you already have a teammate and is looking for a third) you can send an
e-mail to <a href="mailto:ordf@lithekod.se">ordf@lithekod.se</a> with
"ncpc-registration" somewhere in the title. Tell us if you are qualified for
ICPC or not and if you want to compete on campus or not.

Qualification for NWERC can only be offered to teams that are [qualified for
ICPC](https://icpc.global/regionals/rules), meaning all team members:

* Have not participated in ICPC two different years.
